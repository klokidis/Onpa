# Onpa Assistant - Thesis App

**Onpa Assistant** is an Android application designed to support individuals with hearing or speaking loss. The app listens to spoken language, generates context-aware response suggestions using an AI model, allows the user to select and play a response using Text-to-Speech (TTS), and detects important environmental sounds (such as sirens or alarms) to help protect users in critical situations.
